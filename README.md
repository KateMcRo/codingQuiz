# Timed Coding Quiz

## Description

This timed quiz can help test the user's understanding of basic javascript. 

This project presented several interesting challenges:

- Working with objects to populate different portions of the page with data
- Using event listeners to evaluate the user's response and effect the timer
- Utilizing local storage and using JavaScript to create new elements on the page with that data

This project really instilled in me the value of console logs. There were a lot of moving pieces and they didn't always end up how I expected them to so using console logs to figure out where things were going wrong was really helpful.

## Usage

Click "Start Game" to begin quiz. Select one of the answers to the question to move to the next question. Once all questions are answered or timer runs out, you can input your intitials to save your score.
